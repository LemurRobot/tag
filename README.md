# Cat Tag 2 is HERE!

Yet another *LemurRobot* game to enjoy!

## New features Proton Tag didn't have:

- Music
- Jumping (It has been greatly improved)
- **Dashing**
- 2.5D art style
- Sound effects
- Online **multiplayer**
- **Multiple colors** for cats
- **Aura**

## Instructions for idiots:
- **Arrow keys** to move
- **X** to jump (3 second cooldown)
- **Z** to dash (1 second cooldown)
- Tag people by bumping into them
- You lose if the bomb explodes while you are carrying it.
- (+3) Aura for wins
- (-5) Aura for losses

## Still not entirely perfect! If it crashes try reloading, does not run on mobile.
